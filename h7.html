            <p>of the party convened by his nephew Ajit Pawar, and said those using his image are aware that they have nothing else. The group led by Ajit Pawar had placed the picture of Sharad Pawar along with their leaders and also prominently displayed the party's election symbol 'clock'. "NCP has created strong leadership in Maharashtra over last 24 years. Today we may not be in power, but we are in people's hearts. No need to worry, won't allow anyone to snatch NCP's symbol," he said. “Just a few days ago, they (Ajit Pawar) derided chief minister Eknath Shinde, saying they haven't seen such a CM in all these years, but today they have joined him,” he added. Meanwhile, Election Commission has received a petition from Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar staking claim to Nationalist Congress Party and the party symbol, news agency ANI quoted sources as saying.</p>
